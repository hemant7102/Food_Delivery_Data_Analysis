# Food_Delivery_Data_Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a food delivery platform dataset by combining multiple data sources and performing business analytics using Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook.
The goal is to create a unified dataset and extract meaningful insights such as revenue trends, customer behavior, city-wise performance, cuisine analysis, and membership impact.

These datasets were merged into a single file:
